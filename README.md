Text Analytic using Text Mining

# Objective:
1. Prepare text data through data cleaning for preprocessing.
2. Determine the occurrence frequency of terms (words or phrases) in movie reviews using Document-Term Matrix (DTM).
3. Standardize text data into a consistent format suitable for analysis.
4. Conduct text analysis to assess term frequency, term reduction, and term correlation.
5. Identify the most frequent words in the movie reviews.
   
# Summary of Analysis:
Theres a several key insign emerged:
1. Text preprocessing involved removing irrelevant numbers and punctuation, converting words to lowercase, and eliminating stopwords.
2. Through the use of Document-Term Matrix (DTM), several words with the highest frequency were identified, enabling the exploration of relationships and patterns among them.
3. Stemming and lemmatization were employed to streamline the words in the text.
4. Term frequency reveals how often words appear, term reduction simplifies the text, and term correlation indicates word relationships, enhancing our understanding and analysis of text data.
5. The histogram highlights that words such as "film," "movie," and "good" have the highest frequency, suggesting positive movie reviews.

# Data Analysis

*Histogram: Displays the most frequent numerical values found in movie reviews.
*Wordcloud: Illustrates the frequency of words in the reviews, visually emphasizing the most common ones.
*Dendrogram: Reveals word relationships by visualizing clustering outcomes, aiding in identifying patterns within the data.
